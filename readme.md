# Home Assistant Configuration
## About
I use this repository to store my personal Home Assistant configuration - mostly as a last resort means of backup, but if it inspires anyone to try something new, I'd be very happy to be of service. The idea is also to keep some sort of history about my opinions of different devices and services, as I'll intend to write a sentance or two about the tools that I am using. 

## Home Assistant Philosophy
The idea is to create a smart, local and private home. The goal of reaching 100% privacy and being fully local will probably never be fully reached, as some services that I use still relies on cloud services, and I value them too much to get rid of them completely. Nevertheless, if it can run locally, it will. 

Another big guideline that I live by is that the home should still *work* if everything automated fails. The lights should still turn on, the curtains should go up, and so on. Home automation exists to easen our lives, not to make ourselves dependant on it.

### Cameras
- [Reolink RLC-410](https://reolink.com/product/rlc-410/) - Some people are reporting issues using Reolink cameras with Frigate and thus they are not recommended hardware for Frigate. However, I personally never had any problems and it's been very stable for me. Powered over PoE.
- [TP-Link C200](https://www.tp-link.com/se/home-networking/cloud-camera/tapo-c200/) - Although an indoor camera I had one mounted outside under a roof for over a year, and it seems to be doing fine. However, I don't recommend using wifi cameras as it can occasionally drop out.
