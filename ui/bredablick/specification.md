# Specification
This is an overview of what objectives this dashboard should fulfill, what it should contain and how it should work. (This is written before creation.)

*In norse mythology, "Bredablick" was the home of the god Balder. It is the most peaceful and least terrifying place that Balder could find to build his home on. In Swedish it literally translates to "wide look", but is commonly used as a term for being broad-minded.*

## Objectives
In the broad sense, this dashboards objective is __monitoring__ rather than __interaction__. It could end up with some on/off toggles, scenes and such, but detailed control of the house should be done through a separate (mobile) dashboard - or, if possible, automations.

## Design ideas
- 1/1 aspect ratio button cards should be the core of the dashboard
- Maybe some smaller 1/1 cards as well for simple sensors (bools etc)
- Some 1/2 (wide) cards could be acceptable for graph cards etc
- Color scheme should be a primary and a secondary color, on a black (#000) background

## Components
- Energy usage (graph)
- Alarm
- Cameras
- Garbage collection
- Sonos speakers
- TV
- Bedroom Cover
- Desktop
- Person location
- No of lights on
- Pollen
- House temperatures
- Weather
- Vacuum
- Server status 
- Network status
- Train departures

## Compability
The dashboard should be responsive and viewable on both vertical and horizontal (large screens). Should work on mobile as well, but as a secondary means. I'll probably end up using a grid with media queries for this.
